# Iris Dataset Exploration | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Task Objective
The objective of this task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to understand feature distributions, relationships, and species-level patterns. This task was completed as part of my data science internship to practice data exploration and visualization using Python.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Approach
- Loaded the Iris dataset into a Jupyter Notebook.
- Performed basic data inspection including shape, data types, and class labels.
- Applied descriptive statistics to analyze feature distributions.
- Created scatter plots to visualize relationships between sepal and petal features.
- Used color encoding to compare species-level differences.

## Results and Insights
- The dataset consists of three flower species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
- Petal length and petal width provide strong separation between species.
- Setosa is clearly distinguishable from the other two species.
- Versicolor and Virginica show partial overlap but still follow identifiable patterns.
- Sepal measurements alone are less effective for classification compared to petal features.
